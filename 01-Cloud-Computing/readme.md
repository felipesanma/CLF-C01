# Cloud Computing

## 6 advantages to cloud computing

1. Go global in minutes
2. Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers
3. Benefit from massive economies of scale
4. Increase speed and agility
5. Stop guessing capacity
6. Trade capital expense for variable expense

## Tech benefits

1. High Availability
    * Operate continuously without failure for a long time.
2. Elasticity
    * Provision only what you need, and gor or shrink base on demand
3. Agility
    * Innovate faster
4. Durability
    * Long-term data protection

## Cloud computing models

1. IaaS
    * Building blocks that can be rented
2. SaaS
    * Complete Application, on demand, that someone offers to users.
3. PaaS
    * Used by Developers
    * Develop software using web-based tools wihtout worrying about the underlying infrastructure

## Cloud deployments models

1. Private cloud
    * On-premise
2. Public cloud
    * AWS
    * You aren't responsible for the physical hardware
3. Hybrid Cloud
    * Mix between Private and Public cloud

## AWS Global Infrastructure

* Region
    * Physical location
    * Fully independent and isolated
    * Resource and service specific

* Availability Zones
    * One or more physycally separated data centers
        * Each with redundant power, networking, and connectivity, housed in separate facilities.
    * Connected through low-latency links
    * Fault tolerant
    * Allows for high availability

* Edge locations
    * Cache content for fast delivery to your users (CDN and Amazon Cloudfront)
    * Reduce **latency**
